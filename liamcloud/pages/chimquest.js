                <p>As time passes by, I‚Äôm more aware of my cognitive abilities which are, I think, quite low compared to what I believed for years.</p>
                <p>The reason for this disparity is a massive Dunning-Kruger effect. As I drew my attention to many intellectual topics (Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Economics‚Ä¶), I built a surface understanding that sufficed into making me confident of my knowledge on these topics.</p>
                <p>Each small Dunning-Kruger effect (one for each topic) piled up into a bigger one that mistakenly made me believe I had the cognitive abilities and knowledge needed to confidently face the world.</p>
                <p>Having a deeper and clearer awareness of my low abilities and knowledge is not a factor that can lead to a career shift or anything of the sort as I enjoy the hope that the work I do provides me. The hope that someday, I might build something useful, that other people will find worthy of their dollars.</p>
                <p>I can‚Äôt give up anyway, that would infirm my worldview on the effectiveness of capitalism. So suddenly, my life turns out to be an experiment on the effectiveness of capitalism. If I (considering I have an average IQ), can bend reality to my will (wealth, happiness and knowledge), then you can too.</p>
                <p>Go capitalism! The Chimp Quest in on!</p>
